### 5. Replace usePromise with TanStack Query
- [x] Install @tanstack/react-query and @tanstack/react-query-devtools
- [x] Set up QueryClient and QueryClientProvider in App.tsx
- [x] Add query devtools for development
- [x] Migrate useSchool hook to use useQuery
- [x] Migrate useSchoolList hook to use useQuery
- [x] Configure cache times and stale times appropriately
- [x] Remove custom usePromise hook
- [x] Add comprehensive test suite with Vitest and React Testing Library:
  - [x] Add tests for all custom hooks (useSchool, useSchoolList, useLocalStorage, useWindowSize)
  - [x] Add tests for app route resolution (8 tests)
  - [x] Add tests for all page components (SchoolsListPage, SchoolPage, ClustersPage, AboutPage)
  - [x] Add tests for all display components (Header, all cards, tables, pagination)
  - [x] Add tests for map components (MapboxGLPointMap, MapboxGLClusteredMap, MapCard)
  - [x] Achieve 97%+ code coverage (158 tests across 21 test files)
  - [x] Fix all act() warnings in async tests using waitFor
  - [x] Configure coverage exclusions (main.tsx, .d.ts files, test utilities)
- [x] Add mui skeletons for individual loading states rather than full page spinner

### 6. Add Path Aliases
- [ ] Configure path aliases in tsconfig.json (@/ ‚Üí src/)
- [ ] Configure path aliases in vite.config.ts
- [ ] Refactor imports to use aliases (start with most nested files)
- [ ] Test build and development mode
- [ ] Update ESLint to recognize path aliases

### 7. Code Splitting & Bundle Optimization
- [x] Implement lazy loading for top-level page routes (ClustersPage, SchoolPage, SchoolsListPage, AboutPage)
- [x] Add Suspense boundaries with loading fallbacks for lazy-loaded routes
- [x] Configure Vite code-splitting via build.rollupOptions.output.manualChunks
- [x] Split large dependencies into separate chunks (Mapbox, MUI, Nivo)
- [x] Test that lazy loading works correctly in production build
- [x] Verify bundle sizes are under 500KB per chunk

### 8. Evaluate Mapbox GL vs React-Map-GL Migration ‚úÖ Complete
- [x] Analyze current Mapbox GL usage in MapboxglClusteredMap.tsx
- [x] Analyze current Mapbox GL usage in MapboxglPointMap.tsx
- [x] **Decision:** Migrate to react-map-gl with MapLibre GL and MapTiler
- [x] Install react-map-gl and maplibre-gl dependencies
- [x] Migrate MapboxglPointMap to react-map-gl (simplified to 37 lines, removed all TypeScript suppressions)
- [x] Migrate MapboxglClusteredMap to react-map-gl with clustering (cleaner declarative API)
- [x] Update environment variables to use VITE_MAPTILER_KEY
- [x] Remove old mapbox-gl and @types/mapbox-gl dependencies
- [x] Update CLAUDE.md to reflect new mapping technology
- [x] Verify build succeeds and all TypeScript errors resolved
- [ ] Update README screenshots (outdated - from before major style refactor)

### 9. Improve TypeScript Strictness ‚úÖ Complete
- [x] Document all TypeScript strict mode linting errors (`doc/typescript-strict-errors.md` since cleaned up)
- [x] Fix Priority 1 errors: Template literals, unused directives (quick wins)
- [x] Fix Priority 2 errors: Type safety for APIs, test mocks, localStorage
- [x] Add stricter null checks where needed
- [x] Fix any loose typing in usePromise (replaced with TanStack Query)
- [x] Add proper return types to all functions
- [x] Enable additional strict flags in tsconfig if not already
- [x] All ESLint strict mode errors resolved (except intentional Mapbox suppressions)

## ‚ö° Phase 3: Performance & UX

### 10. Performance Optimizations
- [x] Evaluate virtual scrolling for PaginatedSchoolsTable (not needed - pagination already limits DOM to 12-24 rows)
- [x] Install TanStack Virtual if needed (skipped - not beneficial)
- [x] Implement virtual scrolling if beneficial (skipped - pagination is more appropriate)
- [ ] Add React.memo to expensive map components
- [x] Use useDeferredValue for search input
- [ ] Profile application with React DevTools Profiler

### 11. Error Boundaries
- [ ] Create ErrorBoundary component
- [ ] Add error boundary around route components
- [ ] Add error boundary around map components

- [x] Configure accessibility linting rules (approved)
- [x] Fix any accessibility violations (approved) - 0 violations found!
- [ ] Add keyboard navigation for map interactions
- [ ] Audit color contrast ratios
- [x] Add proper ARIA labels where missing (approved) - completed in Phases 1-3
- [ ] Test with screen reader

### 13. Mobile Layout Improvements
- [ ] Rebuild Header component with burger navigation menu for xs screens
  - [ ] Create mobile drawer/menu component
  - [ ] Move navigation items (Schools, Clusters, About) into burger menu
  - [ ] Keep theme toggle and (optionally) GitHub link in header
  - [ ] Ensure proper focus management and keyboard navigation
  - [ ] Test accessibility with burger menu
- [ ] Refactor container/layout architecture
  - [ ] Create/update Layout component to include Container
  - [ ] Hoist Container from individual pages to Layout component
  - [ ] Reduce Container padding at xs breakpoint for better mobile spacing
  - [ ] Audit and fix viewport unit (vw/vh) hacks across the codebase
  - [ ] Test all pages at various breakpoints to ensure consistent layout

## üèóÔ∏è Phase 4: Architecture & Developer Experience

### 14. API Service Layer
- [ ] Create src/services/api.ts
- [ ] Extract SQL query builders from hooks
- [ ] Move API endpoint configuration to service
- [ ] Create typed API response handlers
- [ ] Update hooks to use service layer
- [ ] Add JSDoc documentation for API functions

### 15. Developer Experience

- [x] Replace search icon with pseudo-element implementation (already on MUI icon)
- [x] Improve text overflow CSS on school detail page (fixed in 3.0.0)
- [x] Update all error messages to be user-friendly (clear messages with retry actions)

## üß™ Phase 5: Testing ‚úÖ Complete

### 17. Testing Infrastructure
- [x] Install Vitest and @testing-library/react
- [x] Configure Vitest with happy-dom environment
- [x] Install @testing-library/jest-dom and @testing-library/user-event

## Notes

- Each checkbox represents a subtask that should be committed separately when possible
- Major dependency updates should be tested in isolation before proceeding
- Update this file as progress is made
- Document any blockers or decisions in GitHub issues
- The react-map-gl evaluation is critical before making other map-related changes
